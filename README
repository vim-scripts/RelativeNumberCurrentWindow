DESCRIPTION
The 'relativenumber' setting helps you use the [count] for even quicker
navigation and manipulation, but it's only useful in the current window, where
the cursor is. For all other windows, the absolute line numbers offer a better
orientation (e.g. when you have the same buffer in splits above and below your
current window, and you need to decide which contains a location you want to
go to).

This plugin sets up autocmds to show relative numbers only in the current
window, and switches them to absolute numbers when the window is left. Windows
that do not have 'relativenumber' set are left as-is.

SEE ALSO
- The CursorLineCurrentWindow plugin (vimscript #4178) enables the
  'cursorline' setting only for the current window.

RELATED WORKS
- RelOps (vimscript #4212) switches to relative numbering only when in
  operator-pending mode.
- vim-numbertoggle (http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2012/relative-line-numbers-in-vim-for-super-fast-movement/)
  turns off relative numbering in insert mode, or when the focus is lost.
- numbers.vim (https://github.com/myusuf3/numbers.vim) will alternate between
  relative numbering in normal mode and absolute in insert mode.

USAGE
Globally enable 'relativenumber' in your vimrc via
    :set relativenumber
After sourcing this plugin, 'relativenumber' will only be active for the
current window. So with multiple split windows, only one of them, the one
where the cursor is in, will have the 'relativenumber'; all others will have
'number' set.
